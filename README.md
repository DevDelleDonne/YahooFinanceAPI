## YahooFinanceKit · API Client Framework for Swift

The Yahoo Finance API can do a lot, but it’s not easy to get started.

With YahooFinanceKit, it’s easy to build apps that search and show Yahoo Fiance content—without worrying about the raw API. Instead of exposing all options and endpoints, Yahoo Finance provides comfortable access to the most interesting parts for building a reader app. 

The YahooFinanceKit framework is written in Swift, has no third-party dependencies, and runs on macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
